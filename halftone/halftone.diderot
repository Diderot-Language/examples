## halftone.diderot: Half-toning via interacting repulsive particles

This example is based on the [`sphere.diderot`](../sphere) example, which in
turn is based on the [`circle.diderot`](../circle) example; both of these
should be read and understood first.  While in those cases a surface (circle
or sphere) is sampled uniformly, in this case the flat surface of an image is
sampled non-uniformly, according to the image intensity.  This creates a
result similar to the [Electrostatic
Halftoning](http://www.mia.uni-saarland.de/Research/Electrostatic_Halftoning/index.shtml)
method of Schmaltz et al. The very regular hexagonal grid patterns that this
program generates by energy minimization in uniform areas may be sub-optimal
for artistic or signal-processing purposes; this program lacks the jittering
that better haltoning methods add to avoid this.  The regular sampling
generated by this program could help subsequent meshing.

The standard test for this kind of program is a linear ramp, which is
available via:

	#!
	#I due to non-deterministic parallelism and FP sensitivity
	../fs2d/fs2d-scl -which 0 -width 2 -size0 401 -size1 401 |
	  unu crop -min 0 100 -max M M-100 |
	  unu affine -1 - 1 0 1 |
	  unu pad -min -2 -2 -max M+2 M+2 -o img.nrrd
	rm -f out.nrrd
	#_ junk img.nrrd

The domain of this `img.nrrd` is [-1,1] along X, and [-0.5,0.5] along Y, and
which varies from 0 at X=-1 to 1 at X=1. Two extra samples are added at
the boundaries to ensure that even at the boundary, the `inside()` test
passes. With this proxy image in place, we can compile:

	diderotc --snapshot --exec halftone.diderot
	#prog halftone.diderot

We use snapshots to monitor the progress of computation.  To make `NN` initial
positions with random number seen `RNG` that fit within the ramp image domain:

	NN=300
	RNG=5
	echo 0 0 | unu pad -min 0 0 -max M $((NN-1)) |
	  unu 1op rand -s $RNG | unu affine 0 - 1 -1 1 -o vec2.nrrd
	echo 1 0.5 | unu 2op x vec2.nrrd - -o vec2.nrrd
	#_ junk vec2.nrrd

Then to run with snapshots saved every iteration (`-s 1`), but limiting the program
to 800 iterations (`-l 800`), as well as cleaning results from previous run:

	rm -f pos-????.{png,nrrd} pos.nrrd
	#^ ./halftone -s 2 -l 800 -radmm 0.04 1 -eps 0.0001 -pcp 2
	#_ if true; then  # (begin possible block comment)
	#_ echo "##### FIRST (smaller, faster) TEST; should converge within -l limit"
	#_ ./halftone -s 0 -l 800 -radmm 0.04 1 -eps 0.0001 -pcp 2

Running with this large value (0.04) of minimum radius (considering the image domain)
is good for giving a visual impression of how the particle system populates the
domain. Next, some `unu` hacking makes images of the evolving system, which
are then turned into an animated `ramp.gif` (compare to `[ramp-ref.gif](ramp-ref.gif)).

On the other hand, to quantitatively check that the particle density is as it should be,
we run with many more particles (which can take a few minutes to finish). The following
uses `-radmm 0.004 1` (versus `-radmm 0.04 1` above) for the particle computation,
so that inter-particle distance may be a tenth of what it was previously (resulting in
up to 100 times greater particle density).  A histogram of the X positions, plotted
above the rasterized image of the particle positions, provides visual confirmation that
horizontal (X position) particle density approaches the linear ramp expected from the
linear ramp of the underlying image.

The top part of the resulting `hp.gif` (compare to [`hp-ref.gif`](hp-ref.gif)) shows the
expected convergence to a linear variation in particle density, even though there are
too many particles to individually distinguish in the rasterized image.

Finally, to have some fun with a picture of [Diderot
himself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Diderot), we invert the
image intensity and darken a bit (tending to have more space between
particles), recompile with the new proxy image (the array axis sizes changed),
and then run with new initial positions (without snapshots this time):

	#R   not clear that this reveals anything new
	unu 2op - 1 ../data/ddro.nrrd | unu gamma -g 0.75 -o img.nrrd
	diderotc --exec halftone.diderot
	NN=1000
	RNG=5
	echo 0 0 | unu pad -min 0 0 -max M $((NN-1)) |
	  unu 1op rand -s $RNG | unu affine 0 - 1 -1 1 -o vec2.nrrd
	./halftone -l 800 -radmm 0.01 0.2 -eps 0.000009 -pcp 1
	#_ unu jhisto -i pos.nrrd -min -1 -1 -max 1 1 -b 100 100 -o ddro-jhisto.nrrd

	#^   cat head.eps - tail.eps > ddro.eps
	#^ epstopdf ddro.eps

The `ddro.eps` is generated with the help of `head.eps` and `tail.eps`,
which assume that the points live inside the domain [-1,1]x[-1,1].
The final command for generating `ddro.pdf` is the
[`epstopdf`](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/epstopdf?lang=en) that comes
with some LaTeX installations, but there are many other ways
to convert from eps to pdf. The `ddro.pdf` result (compare to [`drro-ref.pdf`](ddro-ref.pdf))
should look something like the `ddro.png` produced by

	#R
	unu quantize -b 8 -i ../data/ddro.nrrd -o ddro.png

Note that the minimum particle radius specified to `-radmm` was `0.01`, hence
at their tightest packing particles were 0.01 away from each other (they sat
in each other's potential wells, at radius 0.01). Drawing each point with a
circle of radius 0.005 (via `sed` above) creates, where the field is highest
(where `ddro.nrrd` is darkest), a dense packing of mutually tangent circles,
which is visible in the output.
