## fs3d-scl.diderot: utility for generating synthetic scalar 3D datasets

(This is based on [`fs2d-scl.diderot`](../fs2d) example; some
copy-and-pasting was involved).

This programs generates synthetic scalar 3D data on regular grids, and
the grids have specific location and orientation in world space.
The input arguments here make it easy to sample the same underlying
function on grids with differing orientation, resolution, and shear.

Assuming the directions at https://github.com/Diderot-Language/examples
this program can be compiled with:

	../../vis12/bin/diderotc --exec fs3d-scl.diderot

The `-which` option will determine which function is sampled; look
for `(0 == which)` below to see the function definitions, this
includes 3D functions used to make datasets for
[some](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~glk/pubs/#VIS-2003)
[previous](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~glk/pubs/#VIS-2009)
[papers](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~glk/pubs/#VIS-2014).

This program is unusual in that its printed output needs to be captured
in order to have a NRRD header that records the orientation of the
sampling grid, so using the program involves redirection.  To
get a self-contained parab.nrrd containing a parabola function

	./fs2d-scl -which 3 | unu save -f nrrd -o parab.nrrd
	rm out.nrrd

Note that like in [`fs2d-scl.diderot`](../fs2d), the NRRD header
generated by this program assumes:

1. This program was not compiled with `--double`
2. The program is running on a little-endian machine.
