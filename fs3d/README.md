## fs3d-scl.diderot: utility for generating synthetic scalar 3D datasets

This is based on [`fs2d-scl.diderot`](../fs2d) example (some
copy-and-pasting was involved). Note that like in that, the NRRD header
generated by this program assumes:

1. This program was not compiled with `--double`
2. The program is running on a little-endian machine.
