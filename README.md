Example programs in the Diderot language

These examples demonstrate the various features of the Diderot language.
As a Diderot user, these examples are useful starting points for adapting and modifying for your
own purposes. You can help by fixing issues that arise, and contributing new example programs.

As Diderot is a fairly new language, the best practices for packaging up these examples and their
associated files is still evolving.  Patience and/or fearless engagement is appreciated.
