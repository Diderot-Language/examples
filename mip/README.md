## mip.diderot: basic maximum intensity projection (MIP) volume rendering

(docs in progress)

This has code that is re-used verbatim in other examples, both for
setting up the ray-casting geometry given the camera specification, as
well as for sampling along rays. This may later become a target for evolving
Diderot to support libraries that contain common functionality.
